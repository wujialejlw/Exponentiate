# Exponentiate

This is a minimal working example for my first R package for STAT545~

The goal of Exponentiate is to compute common powers.. (and definitely not be misspelt)

## Installation

You can install the development version of Exponentiate like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github(wujialejlw/Exponentiate)
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(Exponentiate)

square(5)

cube(5)
```
